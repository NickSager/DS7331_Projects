    "The data we are working with is part of the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) digit recognition dataset for computer vision. The version we are using for this project is available from on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset contains a large collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). This dataset is very commonly used in machine learning, and the objective is to correctly classify the digit in each image. Identifying handwritten digits is a common problem in many business use cases; a classifier could be used to automatically read addresses on envelopes, to read handwritten numbers on bank checks for mobile deposit, or to help grade tests in an educational setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we set out to explore the MNIST dataset using clustering techniques. Labels are available for this data, which makes it a good candidate for many other machine learning techniques. For example, the viability of Neural Networks for classifying digits has been well documented. In practice, labelling tens of thousands of handwritten digits may time and cost prohibitive. We believe that clustering has the potential to identify groups of similar digits, which could be more easily and efficiently labelled. This would allow generalization of handwriting recognition outside of digits, and even the English language. This would be especially useful in situations where labelling is cost prohibitive, or one just wants to do a rough grouping as part of the EDA on a fresh dataset. Labelling in this way could then serve as a preprocessing step for training more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our clustering analysis we will primarily use clustering metrics such as RAND, adj. RAND, inertia (SSE) and silhouette score to assess the performance of different clustering methods. We will then do a visual EDA or the digits in each cluster to assess whether it looks like the algorithm is working well. Finally, we will assess the accuracy in classifying digits after labelling the clusters. Although this is not necessarily a valid metric for assessing clustering performance, it provides useful validation for using this method on unlabelled data as a preprocessing step for supervised learning. Neural Networks regularly achieve accuracies of more than 99% on this dataset [@MNIST]. We do not expect to achieve this level of accuracy, but we do expect to be able to identify clusters of digits with similar characteristics. The clusters will also be visually evaluated for separation in order to judge the feasibility of using them as a preprocessing step for other machine learning techniques."

    "The MNIST data comes in two comma separated value files for the training and test data. Each row in the files contains the label for the digit, followed by 784 columns of pixel values. The pixel values are stored as integers between 0 and 255, which represent the grayscale value of the pixel. The training data contains 42,000 records, and the test data contains 28,000 records. The test data doesn't contain labels, and is used to evaluate model performance when submitted to Kaggle."

    "The first thing we will do with the data is reduce the feature space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 784 features is fairly high. As shown below, we can explain most of the variance with just 100 principal components. Reducing the feature space will make clustering algorithms more efficient as it will reduce noise and help with the curse of dimensionality. The curse is that determining distance becomes more difficult in high-dimensional spaces because the distance between points becomes more similar as the number of dimensions increases. In addition to improving separation, reducing the feature space will also reduce the likelihood of overfitting, make some visualizations more possible, and require less processing power.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn's implementation of KMeans has several parameters which can take on different values. We will use a grid search to find the best parameters for our data. Because silhouette score is not natively available to tune the grid search one and we have the labels for the training data, we will use the adjusted RAND score. In an implementation where labels are truly not available, silhouette score or another alternative would be a better choice and one could implement a custom scorer."
